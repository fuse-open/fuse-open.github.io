## Expressive design tools for living, breathing UX

Fuse is a set of tools for creating user experiences that enrich the world and propel the art form, giving designers and developers, students and veterans alike, a way to fearlessly innovate on real world projects in a fraction of the effort.

### UX markup for next-gen look and feel

Build interfaces with UX Markup: A concise, declarative XML-based language for creating
rich user experiences backed by a world class layout engine and OpenGL-accelerated visuals. UX markup has been designed to be highly expressive, intuitive to learn and very difficult to break.

### Living, dynamic UI

With UX markup, motion is a first-class citizen and nearly every property is animatable. Using simple expressions you can quickly transition from a static layout into wiring its properties together to form intricate responsive animations. If that's not enough, you can use full motion video assets for that final splash of life to really make your UI sing.

### Modern JavaScript for pure business logic

In Fuse, client-side business logic is written in simple JavaScript. With Apple JavaScriptCore or Google V8 on a separate thread, script execution rarely impacts UI performance. If you're familiar with the words `module.exports` you're pretty much good to go.

## Crossfade prototype into production

### Rapid iteration with live reload

Fuse is designed to offer a playful, real-time workflow where the project can be modified as it is running. Using a local zero-config development server, any changes committed to UX, script or assets causes near instant updates in the running application.

### High performance production code

Once a Fuse project looks and feels right, the difference between prototype and final production code could just be a compiler flag away: UX markup compiles to high performance C++ or .net bytecode, meaning designers can take ownership of final look and feel all they way up to release day.

## Open cross-platform tooling

Fuse projects are written in plain-text source code. This lets you use whatever text editors and design tools you prefer, with extra convenience features available if your chosen editor leverages Fuse's open [plugin API](https://fuse-open.github.io/docs/technical-corner/fuse-protocol). Mature plugins offering problem solving, code completion and project management already exist for Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code and Atom.

### iOS, Android and .NET/Mono

With a shared codebase in UX Markup and JavaScript applications can be deployed to both iOS and Android as well as Windows and OSX. Further native platform features can be accessed by adding Objective-C, Swift, C# or Java code directly to your project to implement the hooks that allow them to be used (and reused) from script and markup.

### Native platform debugging

For Android and iOS, Fuse projects compile to Android Studio and XCode projects that can be debugged and extended any way you wish, and play nice with the native debugging and profiling features.

### Assets and design tools

In Fuse, design and development should become one integrated process. Assets such as fonts, images, videos and sound can be created and updated from any popular design tool and will live-reload just like any source code file.
