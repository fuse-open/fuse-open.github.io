# Fuse

Welcome to the new home for the [Fuse](https://fusetools.com) Open Source
project.

## What is Fuse?

Fuse is a cross-platform mobile app development platform, supporting building
Android and iOS applications.

## How do I get started?

Well, Fuse is available either as an
[installer from the downloads-page](downloads) for end-user, or
[as source code](source-code) for those who wants to
tinker with the internals.

### Using the installer

The installers are pretty straight-forward; download the right installers
for your operating system (currently supported: Windows and macOS), install
it, and open Fuse.
